 Objects and Functions.

![image](/image.PNG)
- In Javascript Objects and functions are related in many ways.
- Objects are collections of name value pairs and those values can then be other collections of name value pairs.
- An object can have properties and methods as values, and these can be primitives like boolean, number or a string.
- An object could also have another object connected to it as a child, so to speak.And this is also considered a property
- An object can also contain functions and in those cases the function is called a method when it's sitting on the object.
- It's still a function, but it's connected to an object and so it's called a method.So objects have properties and methods.And these sit in memory so the object will have some sort of address in your computer's memory.And it will have references to these different properties and methods which are also sitting in your computer's memory.
- Now they may be related to the address of that base object concept, or they may not.But either way the object has references to the addresses or the space or the spots where these different properties and methods live.
- So think about about an object as sitting in memory, and then having reference to other things sitting in memory that are connected to it.
- So it knows where its different properties and methods are, that is,primitives, objects, and function that make it up
