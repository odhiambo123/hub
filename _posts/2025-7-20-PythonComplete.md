### Step 1: Create the Basic Structure
A typical tutorial document in Markdown might look like this:

# Python Tutorial: From Beginner to Advanced

## Introduction
Welcome to learning Python! This tutorial will take you from the basics of programming to more advanced concepts. By the end, you'll be able to write efficient and well-structured code.

### Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have:
1. A Python installed on your system.
2. Familiarity with basic computer operations (e.g., file navigation).

---

## Getting Started

### Installing Python
If you don’t already have Python installed, download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/). On Windows, use the installer; on Linux or macOS, install using your package manager.

```bash
# For Ubuntu/MacOS:
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### First Program: "Hello, World!"
Your first Python program will print "Hello, World!" to the console. Open a new file called `hello.py` and type:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Then run it using:

```bash
python hello.py
```

## Learning Python

### Variables and Data Types
Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t need to declare variables before using them.

- **Integers**: `x = 5`
- **Floats**: `y = 3.14`
- **Strings**: `z = "Hello"`
- **Booleans**: `a = True` or `False`

### Basic Operations
Python supports basic arithmetic operations:

```python
print(2 + 3)    # Output: 5  
print(5 * 2)    # Output: 10 
print(4 - 2)    # Output: 2 
print(8 / 2)    # Output: 4.0 (floating point division)
print(8 // 2)   # Output: 4 (integer division)
```

### Control Flow
Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of your program.

```python
x = 5

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x equals 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")  # Output: "x is less than or equal to 10"
```

### Loops
Python supports both `for` and `while` loops.

#### For Loop Example:

```python
# Print numbers from 0 to 4:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
```

#### While Loop Example:

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
```

### Functions
Define your own functions using `def`:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: "Hello, Alice!"
```

## Intermediate Concepts

### Data Structures
Python has several built-in data structures. Let’s explore some of them.

#### Lists:
A list is an ordered collection of items:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list)    # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Accessing elements:
print(my_list[0])   # Output: 1

# Adding to a list:
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)     # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Tuples:
A tuple is similar to a list but immutable (cannot change after creation):

```python
t = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(t[0])    # Output: "apple"
# You cannot do t.append("date") because tuples are immutable.
```

---

### Object-Oriented Programming

Python is an object-oriented programming language. Let’s create a simple class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def greet(self):
        print(f"{self.name}, {self.greet() called on me}!")

person = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person.greet())   # Output: "Alice, my own method!"
```

---

## Advanced Topics

### Error Handling
Use `try`, `except` to handle exceptions.

```python
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero.")
    else:
        print(f"Result: {a}/{b}")

divide(10, 2)   # Output: "Result: 5.0"
divide(10, 0)   # Outputs the error message and prints "Cannot divide by zero."
```

### Modules
Python has a standard library with modules that contain additional functionality.

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(4))    # Output: 2.0 (square root of 4)
print(math.pi)          # Output: approximately 3.14159...
```
