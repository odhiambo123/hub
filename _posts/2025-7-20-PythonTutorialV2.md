## Section 1: Introduction to Python

### What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.

### Why Learn Python?
- **Versatility**: Used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, etc.
- **Readability**: Clean syntax makes it easy to learn and use.
- **Community-driven**: Large open-source community contributes to countless libraries and frameworks.

## Section 2: Getting Started

### Installing Python
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/) from the official website.
2. Follow the installation guide for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Verify installation by running `python --version` in the terminal or command prompt.

### First Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

## Section 3: Basic Syntax and Data Types

### Variables
- Python is ** Dynamically typed**, meaning you don't need to declare a variable's type before using it.
- Example:
  ```python
  x = 5  # integer
  y = "hello"  # string
  z = True  # boolean (True/False)
  ```

### Data Types
| Type        | Example          | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| `int`       | `x = 10`         | Integer     |
| `str`       | `y = "Python"`    | String      |
| `float`     | `z = 3.5`       | Float       |
| `bool`      | `a = True`, `b = False` | Boolean |

### Basic Operations
```python
# Arithmetic operations:
print(2 + 3)   # Output: 5
print(4 * 6)   # Output: 24
print(10 / 2)  # Output: 5.0 (float division)
```

---

## Section 4: Control Flow

### Conditional Statements
```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("x is greater than 3")
else:
    print(f"{x} is not greater than or equal to 3")
```

#### Loops in Python
- **For Loop**: Iterate over a sequence.
  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)
  ```
  
- **While Loop**: Repeat until the condition fails.
  ```python
  n = 0
  while n < 3:
      print(n)
      n += 1
  ```

---

## Section 5: Functions

### Defining a Function
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
- Example usage:
  ```python
  print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: "Hello, Alice!"
  ```

### Built-in Functions
Python has many built-in functions like `len()`, `print()`, and `sorted()`.

---

## Section 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes and Objects
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
print(car.make)  # Output: Toyota
```

- **Encapsulation**: Data is bundled with methods.
- **Inheritance**: You can inherit properties from existing classes.

---

## Section 7: Advanced Data Structures

### Lists vs. Tuples
```python
# List:
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(a[0])   # Output: 1 (integer)
```

```python
# Tuple:
b = ("apple", "banana")
print(b[0])   # Output: "apple" (string)
```

### Dictionaries
```python
d = {"key": "value"}
print(d["key"])  # Output: value
```

---

## Section 8: Working with External Libraries

### NumPy for Numerical Operations
Install and use:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
Example usage:
```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr)   # Output: [1 2 3]
```

### Pandas for Data Analysis
Install and use:
```bash
pip install pandas
```
Example usage:
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)   # Output: DataFrame with columns Name and Age.
```

---

## Section 9: Error Handling and Debugging

### Try...Except
```python
try:
    print(10 / 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
```

---

## Section 10: File Operations in Python

Read from a file:
```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

Write to a file:
```python
with open("new_file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```

---

## Section 11: Advanced Topics

### Regular Expressions (regex)
Use `re` module for pattern matching and manipulation.
Example:
```python
import re

pattern = r"hello"
print(re.search(pattern, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"))
```

### Networking in Python
Install and use:
```bash
pip install requests
```
Example request:
```python
from urllib.request import urlopen

response = urlopen("https://www.example.com")
print(response.status)  # Output: HTTP status code.
```

---

## Section 12: Practice Exercises and Projects

### Exercise 1: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function to generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            next_num = fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2]
            fib_sequence.append(next_num)
        return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(5))   # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

### Exercise 2: Data Analysis Project
Use Pandas to analyze a dataset (e.g., `cars.csv`):
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("cars.csv")
print(data.head())   # Output the first five rows.
```
