<meta name="description" content="It’s time for a new section of this course, called Objects and Functions.In a lot of JavaScript courses,they treat these two concepts as two different subjects to teach.I think that’s a big mistake.Because while in other programming languages, objects andlanguages are two distinct things to talk about, in JavaScript,they’re very, very much related.They’re really, in many ways, the same subject.So let’s talk about objects and functions.The first subject or the first topic we’ll discuss is objects and the dot.Remember we’ve already said that objects are collections of name value pairs and those values can then be other collections of name value pairs. But for our purposes now,let’s look at objects from a little bit of a different perspective.Let’s think about how an object lives or resides in your computer’s memory.An object like we said is a collection of values that are given names.But, what values are we talking about?Well, an object can have properties and methods.So an object can have a primitive sitting off of it, andthat would be called a property.Remember those primitive types that we talked about, soany one of those like a Boolean or a number or a string. An object could have another object connected to it as a child, so to speak. And this is also considered a property.Remember we said the value could be another name value pair collection, orthat is, another object.An object can also contain functions andin those cases the function is called a method when it’s sitting on the object.So it’s still a function but it’s connected to an object.So it’s called a method.So objects have properties and methods.And these sit in memory sothe kind of core object will have some sort of address in your computer’s memory.And it will have references to these different properties andmethods which are also sitting in your computer’s memory.Now they may be related to the address of that base object concept, or they may not.But either way the object has references to the addresses or the space orthe spots where these different properties and methods live.And those addresses might look something like that.So, this may seem a bit obscure.But it’s important for things that we’re going to talk about laterthat you think about an object as sitting in memory, and then havingreferences to other things sitting in memory that are connected to it.So it knows where its different properties and methods are, that is,primitives, objects, and function that make it up.All right, so let’s look at in JavaScripthow we access those slots in memory,those properties and functions of an object.So I have and empty app.js file andI’m going to create our first object, var person.And I’m going to use the syntax equals and instead of a primitivelike a string or a number, I’m going to say new Object.Now, let me be clear.There are better ways to do this, and we’ll cover them shortly.But just for this moment, I am going to use the new Objectsyntax to create a new Object because it’s very obvious what’s going on.So I’m creating a new Object.And this is going to sit in memory.Now I’m going to add properties and methods.So, for example, I can say person, andthen I’m going to use what’s called the computed member access operator.That’s right, an operator.An operator is this.Brackets.And inside those brackets I put the nameof the value that I’m trying to locate in memory.So let’s say firstname.It doesn’t exist yet, so when I use the = Tony,it’s going to create that spot in memory, and give it that name.And this object will get a reference to the address of that location in memory.So, it will know where firstname is in memory andthat’s going to be a primitive, a string.So, it’s called a property, the firstname property.So, this is one way to set and access properties.If I go back to my PDF of JavaScriptoperator precedence, you’ll see that we have Computed Member Access.It’s very near the top.And it’s left-to-right associativity, and it’s brackets there.So this is an operator.What the operator does is it takes this Object and thisproperty or method name, and it looks for this on this Object.It actually can do quite a bit more than that, butwe’ll see that much later in the course.But, for starters this is one way, using a string to access this.So let me set lastname.Now the neat thing about this operator is that I could set a string, let’ssay firstname, and I can then use that string to accessthat property using that bracket notation or that operator.So let me first of all just log the person itself so you can see it.And then I’ll log person.I’ll use this bracket operator and I’ll pass this string,this variable that contains the string.And remember this operator will take this object and look fora property with this name.So this name is firstname so it should find it, and what should it output?Tony.So let’s go ahead and run this in the browser.And then I’ll open my console, and there I see Tony.So the Computed Member Access operator, those brackets worked.They looked at the Object as one parameter and that string as one parameter andwent out and found that property on that Object and gave me the value.Notice I also just outputted the object itself.And I can see those two properties, firstname and lastname.There’s another property, this underscore, underscore, proto, underscore, underscore.Don’t worry about that right now.But we are gonna get into that later in the course.For now, we’ll just focus on these that I’ve named, firstname and lastname.And I’ve outputted it the first name using that special operator with the brackets.So, let’s go back to our code and let’s talk about another operator,the more common operator and clearer andeasier to type operator for accessing properties and methods.Now this approach here that we just talked about,you will see sometimes in frameworks andlibraries because you can dynamically decide what property you’re trying to get.You can base it off a string.But it’s much clearer and easier to type the next one.All right, I’m going console.log the first name again.But I’m going to use a different operator, the dot operator.And it is just what it sounds like.Dot, then I can say, first name.The dot, is an operator, it’s a function.And when used after an Object like that, well,if I go back to my JavaScriptOperatorPrecedence.pdf,you’ll see it’s just second from the top, right after the parentheses for grouping.It’s left to right and it’s just a dot and it takes two parameters,the object that you’re looking at and the name of the property.Notice I don’t have to put this in quotes or something.Although that’s essentially what it’s doing.It’s taking the object and passing the stringthat represents the name of the value that you are looking for.But I don’t have to do that, that’s not a really accurate.You can’t do that.It will simply, the syntax parser will understand that after you put the dot,what you’ve actually typed will be the string that’s given to the dot.That’s just a lot faster to type.Person.firstname, and if I run this since I’m already outputting the person andfirstname again, I’ll just get the firstname again.So I refresh and there it is.You see that?So the dot operator acted exactly the same as the brackets operator here.This is Computed Member Access.And this is just called Member Access,the Member Access operator, members being members of the Object, right?Your fingers and your toes are members of your body.So these are looking for members of the Object, the pieces, the methods, andthe properties.So this went out and found this property because it’s just a string.It’s not called a method.It’s called a property.Okay, so I could console.log person.lastname.Very readable, very easy to type.And that’s what’s really happening.It went out and found that memory location,that reference by name that’s connected to that Object.And I could have set this value as well the same way.In fact remember that the other type of property you can have,as opposed to a primitive, is also another Object.So i can attach another set of names and values.Let’s says that person.address.I’m gonna make that instead of a string or a number ora Boolean, I’ll just make it another new Object.So it’s an Object sitting inside an Object andthen I can use the dot operator for example and add propertiesto my sub-object, my child object, inside of here.Now remember these are operators, so how do we know which one gets run first?Well, we go back and we see that the associativity ofthe Member Access operator is left-to-right.It has left associativity, meaning that the left most dot will get run first, getcalled first, because they’re functions, and then moving on to the right.So this one between person and address gets called first.So it says, okay, I’ll look at the person Object andlook for a property or a method that has that name.And then it finds that in memory.And this second dot operator is called and it says, okay, on that Object that I justfound in memory, I’ll look for a property or a method on that, called street.Now in this case it won’t find it but I’m setting a value soit will create it and give it that initial value.And I could just keep doing this.So I might have address.city.Let’s say New York.And state, let’s say New York.And you could see I could make this other subobject and subobjects and subobjects.And I could just keep going because it’s a left to right dot operator,left associative.And the Objects can keep containing Objects which can contain other Objectswhich can contain other Objects.So, this is very powerful.Realize that the Objects themselves and their properties andmethods are all just sitting in memory.These dots, these brackets, passing strings to them, they’re just functions.They’re just operators, a way to access that information.So now I have this Object sitting in memory.I could do a person.address.street and output that andit’ll go find it in memory running those two different operators.I could go person.address.city and it will find that.And I could on the same object just use a different operator.So I could go address using the computed, this is also left to right.If I look, it’s left to right, so I can also then just do another one.Let’s say, state.This is essentially doing the same thing.It looks at the object, finds a property ormethod called that, runs this operator first.Then the second operator, it’ll look for a state property on that.And the dot is doing the same thing.And they’re both simply accessing the same memory locations via the same names.So they’re just two different functions that are essentially doing the same thing.And I’ll refresh, and there I’m outputting my values,that are sitting in memory, using both operators.So again, Objects are name value pairs sitting in memory.They can contain other name value pairs, that is, other Objects.They can contain other properties, strings, Booleans.They can contain numbers.They can also contain functions, which are called methods.But we’re not going to quite get there yet,because there’s a couple other things we need to understand.But good enough for here.Remember that this is not the preferred way to create a new Object.We’ll get to that in just a second.And also remember that although we can use the dot orwe can use the computed, the bracket notation here for finding properties andmethods, the preferred approach is just using the dot operator.It’s very clean, it’s very clear, and it’s also easier to debug and find problems.So I always recommend that you use the dot operator unless you really need toaccess a property or properties using some kind of dynamic string.Some kind of string that can be changed, that you can look at programmatically.But to start with, always use the dot operator" />

operators, so how do we know which one gets run first?Well, we go back and we see that the associativity ofthe Member Access operator is left-to-right.It has left associativity, meaning that the left most dot will get run first, getcalled first, because they’re functions, and then moving on to the right.So this one between person and address gets called first.So it says, okay, I’ll look at the person Object andlook for a property or a method that has that name.And then it finds that in memory.And this second dot operator is called and it says, okay, on that Object that I justfound in memory, I’ll look for a property or a method on that, called street.Now in this case it won’t find it but I’m setting a value soit will create it and give it that initial value.And I could just keep doing this.So I might have address.city.Let’s say New York.And state, let’s say New York.And you could see I could make this other subobject and subobjects and subobjects.And I could just keep going because it’s a left to right dot operator,left associative.And the Objects can keep containing Objects which can contain other Objectswhich can contain other Objects.So, this is very powerful.Realize that the Objects themselves and their properties andmethods are all just sitting in memory.These dots, these brackets, passing strings to them, they’re just functions.They’re just operators, a way to access that information.So now I have this Object sitting in memory.I could do a person.address.street and output that andit’ll go find it in memory running those two different operators.I could go person.address.city and it will find that.And I could on the same object just use a different operator.So I could go address using the computed, this is also left to right.If I look, it’s left to right, so I can also then just do another one.Let’s say, state.This is essentially doing the same thing.It looks at the object, finds a property ormethod called that, runs this operator first.Then the second operator, it’ll look for a state property on that.And the dot is doing the same thing.And they’re both simply accessing the same memory locations via the same names.So they’re just two different functions that are essentially doing the same thing.And I’ll refresh, and there I’m outputting my values,that are sitting in memory, using both operators.So again, Objects are name value pairs sitting in memory.They can contain other name value pairs, that is, other Objects.They can contain other properties, strings, Booleans.They can contain numbers.They can also contain functions, which are called methods.But we’re not going to quite get there yet,because there’s a couple other things we need to understand.But good enough for here.Remember that this is not the preferred way to create a new Object.We’ll get to that in just a second.And also remember that although we can use the dot orwe can use the computed, the bracket notation here for finding properties andmethods, the preferred approach is just using the dot operator.It’s very clean, it’s very clear, and it’s also easier to debug and find problems.So I always recommend that you use the dot operator unless you really need toaccess a property or properties using some kind of dynamic string.Some kind of string that can be changed, that you can look at programmatically.But to start with, always use the dot

    <h1>Functions</h1>

<p>It’s time for a new section of this course, called Objects and Functions.In a lot of JavaScript courses,they treat these two concepts as two different subjects to teach.I think that’s a big mistake.Because while in other programming languages, objects andlanguages are two distinct things to talk about, in JavaScript,they’re very, very much related.They’re really, in many ways, the same subject.So let’s talk about objects and functions.The first subject or the first topic we’ll discuss is objects and the dot.Remember we’ve already said that objects are collections of name value pairs
and those values can then be other collections of name value pairs.
But for our purposes now,let’s look at objects from a little bit of a different perspective.Let’s think about how an object lives or resides in your computer’s memory.An object like we said is a collection of values that are given names.But, what values are we talking about?Well, an object can have properties and methods.So an object can have a primitive sitting off of it, andthat would be called a property.Remember those primitive types that we talked about, soany one of those like a Boolean or a number or a string.
An object could have another object connected to it as a child, so to speak.
And this is also considered a property.Remember we said the value could be another name value pair collection, orthat is, another object.An object can also contain functions andin those cases the function is called a method when it’s sitting on the object.So it’s still a function but it’s connected to an object.So it’s called a method.So objects have properties and methods.And these sit in memory sothe kind of core object will have some sort of address in your computer’s memory.And it will have references to these different properties andmethods which are also sitting in your computer’s memory.Now they may be related to the address of that base object concept, or they may not.But either way the object has references to the addresses or the space orthe spots where these different properties and methods live.And those addresses might look something like that.So, this may seem a bit obscure.But it’s important for things that we’re going to talk about laterthat you think about an object as sitting in memory, and then havingreferences to other things sitting in memory that are connected to it.So it knows where its different properties and methods are, that is,primitives, objects, and function that make it up.All right, so let’s look at in JavaScripthow we access those slots in memory,those properties and functions of an object.So I have and empty app.js file andI’m going to create our first object, var person.And I’m going to use the syntax equals and instead of a primitivelike a string or a number, I’m going to say new Object.Now, let me be clear.There are better ways to do this, and we’ll cover them shortly.But just for this moment, I am going to use the new Objectsyntax to create a new Object because it’s very obvious what’s going on.So I’m creating a new Object.And this is going to sit in memory.Now I’m going to add properties and methods.So, for example, I can say person, andthen I’m going to use what’s called the computed member access operator.That’s right, an operator.An operator is this.Brackets.And inside those brackets I put the nameof the value that I’m trying to locate in memory.So let’s say firstname.It doesn’t exist yet, so when I use the = Tony,it’s going to create that spot in memory, and give it that name.And this object will get a reference to the address of that location in memory.So, it will know where firstname is in memory andthat’s going to be a primitive, a string.So, it’s called a property, the firstname property.So, this is one way to set and access properties.If I go back to my PDF of JavaScriptoperator precedence, you’ll see that we have Computed Member Access.It’s very near the top.And it’s left-to-right associativity, and it’s brackets there.So this is an operator.What the operator does is it takes this Object and thisproperty or method name, and it looks for this on this Object.It actually can do quite a bit more than that, butwe’ll see that much later in the course.But, for starters this is one way, using a string to access this.So let me set lastname.Now the neat thing about this operator is that I could set a string, let’ssay firstname, and I can then use that string to accessthat property using that bracket notation or that operator.So let me first of all just log the person itself so you can see it.And then I’ll log person.I’ll use this bracket operator and I’ll pass this string,this variable that contains the string.And remember this operator will take this object and look fora property with this name.So this name is firstname so it should find it, and what should it output?Tony.So let’s go ahead and run this in the browser.And then I’ll open my console, and there I see Tony.So the Computed Member Access operator, those brackets worked.They looked at the Object as one parameter and that string as one parameter andwent out and found that property on that Object and gave me the value.Notice I also just outputted the object itself.And I can see those two properties, firstname and lastname.There’s another property, this underscore, underscore, proto, underscore, underscore.Don’t worry about that right now.But we are gonna get into that later in the course.For now, we’ll just focus on these that I’ve named, firstname and lastname.And I’ve outputted it the first name using that special operator with the brackets.So, let’s go back to our code and let’s talk about another operator,the more common operator and clearer andeasier to type operator for accessing properties and methods.Now this approach here that we just talked about,you will see sometimes in frameworks andlibraries because you can dynamically decide what property you’re trying to get.You can base it off a string.But it’s much clearer and easier to type the next one.All right, I’m going console.log the first name again.But I’m going to use a different operator, the dot operator.And it is just what it sounds like.Dot, then I can say, first name.The dot, is an operator, it’s a function.And when used after an Object like that, well,if I go back to my JavaScriptOperatorPrecedence.pdf,you’ll see it’s just second from the top, right after the parentheses for grouping.It’s left to right and it’s just a dot and it takes two parameters,the object that you’re looking at and the name of the property.Notice I don’t have to put this in quotes or something.Although that’s essentially what it’s doing.It’s taking the object and passing the stringthat represents the name of the value that you are looking for.But I don’t have to do that, that’s not a really accurate.You can’t do that.It will simply, the syntax parser will understand that after you put the dot,what you’ve actually typed will be the string that’s given to the dot.That’s just a lot faster to type.Person.firstname, and if I run this since I’m already outputting the person andfirstname again, I’ll just get the firstname again.So I refresh and there it is.You see that?So the dot operator acted exactly the same as the brackets operator here.This is Computed Member Access.And this is just called Member Access,the Member Access operator, members being members of the Object, right?Your fingers and your toes are members of your body.So these are looking for members of the Object, the pieces, the methods, andthe properties.So this went out and found this property because it’s just a string.It’s not called a method.It’s called a property.Okay, so I could console.log person.lastname.Very readable, very easy to type.And that’s what’s really happening.It went out and found that memory location,that reference by name that’s connected to that Object.And I could have set this value as well the same way.In fact remember that the other type of property you can have,as opposed to a primitive, is also another Object.So i can attach another set of names and values.Let’s says that person.address.I’m gonna make that instead of a string or a number ora Boolean, I’ll just make it another new Object.So it’s an Object sitting inside an Object andthen I can use the dot operator for example and add propertiesto my sub-object, my child object, inside of here.Now remember these are operators, so how do we know which one gets run first?Well, we go back and we see that the associativity ofthe Member Access operator is left-to-right.It has left associativity, meaning that the left most dot will get run first, getcalled first, because they’re functions, and then moving on to the right.So this one between person and address gets called first.So it says, okay, I’ll look at the person Object andlook for a property or a method that has that name.And then it finds that in memory.And this second dot operator is called and it says, okay, on that Object that I justfound in memory, I’ll look for a property or a method on that, called street.Now in this case it won’t find it but I’m setting a value soit will create it and give it that initial value.And I could just keep doing this.So I might have address.city.Let’s say New York.And state, let’s say New York.And you could see I could make this other subobject and subobjects and subobjects.And I could just keep going because it’s a left to right dot operator,left associative.And the Objects can keep containing Objects which can contain other Objectswhich can contain other Objects.So, this is very powerful.Realize that the Objects themselves and their properties andmethods are all just sitting in memory.These dots, these brackets, passing strings to them, they’re just functions.They’re just operators, a way to access that information.So now I have this Object sitting in memory.I could do a person.address.street and output that andit’ll go find it in memory running those two different operators.I could go person.address.city and it will find that.And I could on the same object just use a different operator.So I could go address using the computed, this is also left to right.If I look, it’s left to right, so I can also then just do another one.Let’s say, state.This is essentially doing the same thing.It looks at the object, finds a property ormethod called that, runs this operator first.Then the second operator, it’ll look for a state property on that.And the dot is doing the same thing.And they’re both simply accessing the same memory locations via the same names.So they’re just two different functions that are essentially doing the same thing.And I’ll refresh, and there I’m outputting my values,that are sitting in memory, using both operators.So again, Objects are name value pairs sitting in memory.They can contain other name value pairs, that is, other Objects.They can contain other properties, strings, Booleans.They can contain numbers.They can also contain functions, which are called methods.But we’re not going to quite get there yet,because there’s a couple other things we need to understand.But good enough for here.Remember that this is not the preferred way to

preferred approach is just using the dot operator.It’s very clean, it’s very clear, and it’s also easier to debug and find problems.So I always recommend that you use the dot operator unless you really need toaccess a property or properties using some kind of dynamic string.Some kind of string that can be changed, that you can look at programmatically.But to start with, always use the dot operator</p>
